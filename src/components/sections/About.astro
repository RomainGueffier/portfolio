      Hello! My name is Romain and I enjoy building awesome websites that will
      shine on the internet. I started programming back in 2011 after high
      school with C++ and PHP. My first job after my Bachelor Degree was in a
      software company creating CMS and websites for libraries. I ended up
      liking web development for it's creativity, variety and impact on
      customers.
      <br /><br />
      Fast forward a bit in 2021 during pandemic, I've used my job loss as a occasion
      to get better. I focused on personal projects to improve my skills and abilities
      to suggest the correct tool for a given need. I ended up specializing in NodeJS
      and React. Today I help a middle size company grow up by creating performant
      and modern web apps. I push my team forward with my warm support, positive
      attitude and devops methodology!
